# AEROTHEMEPLASMA FOR KDE 6

## WARNING: This version is very early WIP and is not fully finished. Proceed with caution.

## Introduction

This is a project which aims to recreate the look and feel of Windows 7 as much as possible on KDE Plasma, whilst adapting the design to fit in with modern features provided by KDE Plasma and Linux.
It is still in heavy development and testing. ATP has been tested on:

1. Arch Linux x64 and other Arch derivatives, KDE Neon
2. Plasma 6.3.0, KDE Frameworks 6.10.0, Qt 6.8.2
3. 96 DPI scaling, multi monitor
4. X11, Wayland*

*AeroThemePlasma currently lacks full Wayland support, which may result in Wayland-specific issues. 

## This release is meant for early adopters, debuggers and developers alike. This port lacks certain components which still need to be ported over to KDE Plasma 6. I am not responsible for broken systems, please proceed with caution.

The Plasma 5 version of ATP is available as a tag in this repository, however it is unmaintained and no longer supported.

If you find my work valuable consider donating:

## Vista variant

Initially I wanted to make a Vista variant of AeroThemePlasma but [catpswin56](https://gitgud.io/catpswin56) beat me to it, use [VistaThemePlasma](https://gitgud.io/catpswin56/vistathemeplasma/) if you want a Vista theme.
